# elkington

**elkington** is a node.js module for interfacing with the Elk M1 Gold automation controller. 

**This is currently experimental and under development. Not all Elk commands are available**

## Features

* Simple API with function calls for Elk commands
* Supports many Elk commands
* Supports both secure and non-secure communication ports

## Usage

To get started, call `createConnection()` to create a new connection and register some event handlers:

```javascript
var elkington = require('elkington');

/// create a connection
var elk = elkington.createConnection({ 
  port: 2101, 
  host: '192.168.1.13' 
});

// register event handlers
elk.on('any', function(msg){
  console.log('Incoming message: ' + msg.message);
});
```

Or a secure connection can be established...

```javascript
/// create a connection
var elk = elkington.createConnection({ 
  port: 2601, 
  host: 'myelk.myhouse.com',
  username: 'somebody',
  password: 'yoyoyo',
  useSecure: true 
});
```

### Handling events

**elkington** provides a lot of commands. Some of the commands will invoke a response from the controller. You can optionally pass in a callback to these commands.

```javascript
elk.alarmByZoneRequest(function(err, resp){
  if(err) {
    console.log(err.message);
  } else {
    console.log('Got the alarm by zone response');
  }
});
```

Or you can listen for the response in a separate event handler and just call the method.

```javascript
// AZ is the message type for 'Alarm by Zone Reply'
elk.on('AZ', function(msg) {
  console.log('area1 arm status: ' + msg.data.area1.armStatus);
});

elk.alarmByZoneRequest();
```

### Speaking

The Elk M1 has a large library of words that it can say over it's speaker. With the **elkington** `speak()` function, you can make your Elk say all kinds of wacky (or useful) stuff...

```javascript
elk.speak('defective hottub pump');
```

...now something more useful:

```javascript
var elkington = require('elkington');
var request = require('request');
var elk = elkington.createConnection({ port: 2101 , host: '192.168.1.13'});

elk.on('connect', function() {
  
  // say the outside temp on connection to the Elk
  var opts = {
    url: 'http://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql',
    qs: {
      q: 'select item from weather.forecast where location = "48307"',
      format: 'json'
    }
  };
  
  request(opts, function(error, response, body) {
    if(!error) {
      var temp = JSON.parse(body).query.results.channel.item.condition.temp.toString();    
      elk.speak('outside temperature is ' + temp + ' degrees');
    }
  });
  
}); 
```

The speak function can even interpret numerical values

```javascript
// speaker says 'two thousand twelve'
elk.speak('2012');
```

## Event API

### on(event, callback) 

Register an event listener.

## Arm/Disarm API

### disarm([callback])

Disarm the Elk. Callback is optional.

### armAway([options])

Arm the Elk in Away Mode.

### armStay([options])

Arm the Elk in Stay Mode.

### armStayInstant([options])

Arm the Elk in Stay Mode instantaneously.

### armNight([options])

Arm the Elk in Night Mode.

### armNightInstant([options])

Arm the Elk in Night Mode instantaneously.

### armVacation([options])

Arm the Elk in Vacation Mode.

### armStepAway([options])

Arm and step to next Away mode

### armStepStay([options])

Arm and step to next Stay mode

### armingStatusRequest([callback])

Request the arming statuses for all areas. Callback is optional. The callback returns the results of the Arming Status Response sent by the Elk.
